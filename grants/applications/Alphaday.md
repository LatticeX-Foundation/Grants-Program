**Technical Grant Proposal**

Project: Alphaday

**Project Overview**

Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI
We’ve been followers and fans of PlatON Network for a long time and its decentralized, privacy-centric & scalable infrastructure resonates with us since we’ve been trying to build and deploy web3 products for the last 5 years. Our product, Alphaday, will aggregate all the information across the PlatON Network ecosystem into one easy-to-use dashboard so we’re pretty excited to be able to contribute to this ecosystem and its large community.

Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 

**Project Details**

Pitch Deck: https://bit.ly/Alphadaydeck \
Our product is already live in Beta: https://app.alphaday.com/ \
Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

**Project Advantages**

We’ve done market research on users and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

**Team's experience**

I’ve been involved in the Ethereum space since early 2016 and joined Kyber Network in 2017 as Head of Ecosystem Growth before quitting to start Alphaday full-time in 2021. Previously I worked at Thomson Reuters for a decade building financial products that rivaled the Bloomberg Terminal. I am currently also a Venture Partner at IOSG.VC.
My co-founder Felipe has also been involved in Ethereum since 2016 and was a Developer Advocate at Pegasys and Consensys before quitting to work full time on Alphaday.
Alphaday’s third co-founder is DeFiDude who used to be a community manager at both Aave and Kyber Network before co-founding Alphaday.

Our team members have a proven track record of working in successful and growing Ethereum projects as well as extensive experience in the conventional finance world. We’ve also launched our beta product on time during the summer and have been consistently hitting our growth KPIs including growing 40% MoM in terms of MAU.

|1| Maintenance of Dashboard | 12 months of maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day. |

**Future Plans**

Once we’ve created a PlatON Network dashboard, we will promote this across the PlatON Network community and start collecting feedback so that we can keep iterating and improving our dashboard. For us success is if a large number of PlatON Network stakeholders come to the PlatON Network dashboard to stay up to date with everything happening within PlatON Network and then use the available data as jumping off points into the various parts of the PlatON Network ecosystem. i.e. LAT holders using the board to finding trending governance topics to participate in, devs using the resource library to dive deeper into the technical documents, and newcomers listening to the latest podcasts. \
In terms of concrete numbers, considering PlatON Network has 102K twitter followers and using this as a very crude proxy for community size, we would consider it a success if we could serve at least 1% of them on a monthly basis (1.02K MAU). \
The grant work will result in a dashboard dedicated to serving the PlatON Network community by aggregating all relevant information about PlatON Network including media communities, on-chain metrics, PlatON Network academy, PlatON Network tokenomics into one place. Our desired outcome is to provide a new end-point for community engagement and to bolster PlatON Network’s outreach.
